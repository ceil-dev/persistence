## Overview

The library serves as a straightforward interface for managing data storage across multiple levels, making it easier to handle data in systems with hierarchical structures. It simplifies the process of retrieving, updating, and deleting data, so you donâ€™t have to worry about the intricate details of managing storage layers. Depending on availability or priority, data can be stored and accessed from different levels, offering flexibility in how information is managed and retrieved.

This approach streamlines storage operations, providing an efficient way to handle data in complex systems without dealing with the underlying complexity.
